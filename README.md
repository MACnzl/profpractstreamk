# Profesional practise Help file exercise.
Activity instructions

Find three really good help files or instructions and link to them in your repo. For each one, write a few sentences about why you think it is effective.
Find one or two help docs or instructions that you think are ineffective or could be improved and write a few sentences to explain why you think this and what you would change.

Good examples of software help.

Item 1 https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-your-first-Word-2013-document-abfe7d91-98e5-422f-9033-6df5f5998b0a
I think the above link is effective as it breaks down the wWord 2013 areas covered so people can choose the most appropriate task they wouldl ike help with or can start at the beginning and work through, or see if the area of help needed is likely to be covered or not. You can follow the instruction yourself using the installed word software and it shows you where to click on the screen.

Item 2 https://support.google.com/mail/?hl=en#topic=7065107
I find the above help information effective. It is efficient, it provides help information for multiple platforms. It breaks areas of help into categories so it is clear when selected by the user if it might provide the support needed.




Example of Help information that could be improved
http://www.op.ac.nz/hub/student-support/it-support/it-service-desk/
if you need help outside of the stated hours no information is provided.(eg. on a Saturday when it shows as closed)
it is too wordy and using unnecesary names like "Bomgar B200", a student has no need to know the name of the support software used.
Remote support is confusing they state they can only connect to computers that are owned by you, so what if it is a Polytechnic pc?
Common issues is too wordy, they state "Call us if you have any IT issue that impacts on your studies, and weâ€™ll do our best to help" so what is the need to specifically state a number of applilations users may not even use.
